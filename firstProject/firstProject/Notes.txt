- Compilation: process of transforming the source code into a
format that the computer can understand. That's what a compiler'll do.

- After "build", a .exe file is created and we can use that to share
our project with other people. Other files are also important as
the .dll file for example.

- every code in C# is compiled into a .dll

- variables:
    - has to have a type, value and name.
    - variables cannot change type
    - when using the variable for the first time, remember to declare
    the variable type.
    - it is possible to create our own types.
    - strings are texts and ints are full numbers

    - declaration means that a variable with given type and name will
    exist.
    - initialization is assign the value for the given variable.
    - initialization at declariation is creating the variable and assign
    a value at the same line
    - it is possible to declare multiple variables in the same line
    - keywords can't be used as variable names
    - first character cannot be a digit
    - names are case-sensitive.

- operators:
    - +, -, *, /
    - In an expression with multiple operators, the operators with higher precedence
     are evaluated before the operators with lower precedence.
    - always use parenthesis when using operators
    - ++a or --b will increment or decrement  the value by one

- explicitly typed variables are variables initialized with
  specific types as int, strings and etc.
- implicitly typed variables are variables initialized with
  the "var" keyword. They also can't change types after being declared.
